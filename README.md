# Test_cases
<p> This repository contains example test cases created by me during my testing internship. These test cases were designed to validate various functionalities and ensure the quality and reliability of the software being tested. </p>
<p>The test cases were initially created in Excel spreadsheets and then imported into Jira using Zephyr Scale, a powerful test management tool for organizing and tracking test execution.</p>
